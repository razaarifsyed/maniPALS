# maniPALS

This is a Java desktop application, actually created in 2017. I made this as a part of my curriculum's lab project.
Used Netbeans IDE to develop this app in Java. Used MySQL for the database. 

The purpose of this application is to connect the 'teachers' and the 'learners' within our university(Manipal) campus. As the tagline of the app says, "Everyone has something to offer". The teacher here can be anyone really, who is willing to help out a fellow student.Be it help with something academic, or sports, music, gym, dance anything etc. Any service can be asked for and offered vice-versa. 

The learner sends a connect request to the teacher, and if acccepted then he can see his teachers contact info. And further connect with him or just message him within the app. 

The app has many features like Signin/Signup Account Managing system. User profiles(without different abstractions). Messaging service. Sending Friend Request, Friendlist, and of course the main feature - "Teach" or "Learn" a skill.

Notes

After setting up the database, you can run the Java application directly by going to the folder, "dist" and then opening "maniPALS.jar" file. 

To set up the mysql database, please open the "dbs.txt" file. Just copy paste all the code to the mysql terminal. Don't copy the comments in the 'dbs.txt' file too by mistake. The comments are meant for you, to explain all the parts.


Let me know if you need any help or liked my work :)
